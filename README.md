# Cache-Analysis-Project

This program was created as part of Intro to Computer Organization - it is a cache simulator meant to show how the performance of a cache varies under differing conditions, including after different files are read, with its cache associativity, cache size, replacement strategy, and more.
Details on its use are provided both within the program and upon its activation.
